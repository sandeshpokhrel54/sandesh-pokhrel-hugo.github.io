But as &amp;lsquo;AL Green&amp;rsquo; said, “How can you stop the rain from falling down&amp;hellip;?” It rained cats and dogs on our plan. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise as the company grew to six, hills grew thicker with snow and the weather next day was clearer.
The Facebook group was assembled at 6:00 pm a day before the trip, the official start of a trip these days.</description></item><item><title>Buildup to the Finale</title><link>https://sandesh-pokhrel.com.np/posts/2021/05/buildup-to-the-finale/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sandesh-pokhrel.com.np/posts/2021/05/buildup-to-the-finale/</guid><description>UEFA Champions League Final 2021 It’s here, and we have been here before, but its different. There’s fear for the repeat of 2008 but there’s hope for the 2012 miracle. It’s 2021 and we come to Estadio do Dragao as underdogs. Dread the fight but just enough to not let your arrogance get to you, believe that you can and will triumph on your quest, and live, live the moment like you’ll never live it again because you might never live it again.</description></item><item><title>Groundhog Day</title><link>https://sandesh-pokhrel.com.np/posts/2020/05/groundhog-day/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sandesh-pokhrel.com.np/posts/2020/05/groundhog-day/</guid><description>Life during the lockdown Yet another day has come to an end, and like the past two months, I am scratching my head thinking what things I did today were &amp;ldquo;productive&amp;rdquo;. I lay there in my bed recalling the early morning row with my mom because I overslept yet again.
Mom vs me (1-0), if we are keeping scores. It really pissed me off for the first few weeks or so, but I guess, I got used to her rants.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://sandesh-pokhrel.com.np/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sandesh-pokhrel.com.np/about/</guid><description>Computer Engineer in the making&amp;hellip;
