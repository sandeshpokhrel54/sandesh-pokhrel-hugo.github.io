Hi! I'm Sandesh Pokhrel, a passionate computer vision researcher at NAAMII, Nepal under Assistant Professor Binod Bhattarai. I am working at the forefront of medical imaging and advancements in AI and computer vision can improve diagnosis and patient care. My current research focuses on Out-of-Distribution detection in gastrointestinal vision in various modalities. 
I am a graduate from Institute of Engineering(IOE), Pulchowk Campus with diverse experience in research as well as industry having worked on various deep learning techniques. I have experience in out-of-distribution detection, self supervised learning, image and object segmentation, object detection, pose estimation, voice cloning and speech recognition, using these methods to provide software solutions for pressing and practical problems.
As personal interests, I enthusiastically follow football, playing as well as analytics and am a avid star gazer on cloudless night.
Looking forward to connecting with you!
